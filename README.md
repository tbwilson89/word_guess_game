### Week 3 Homework - Word Guess Game JS

This is a simple word guessing game with characters from old school video games as the options for potential answers!

This was a project for initial understanding of basic **JavaScript**. This was built without the assistance of jQuery and was done with a large portion of the game being stored within an object as a test to see what was possible.
I feel that there were a few more things I could have moved around and potentially made into functions or added to the object, but wasn't totally necessary to do so.
